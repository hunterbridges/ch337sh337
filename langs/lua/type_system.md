In Lua, variables are [dynamically typed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type-checking_and_runtime_type_information)
and tables can be used for [duck typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).
Since Lua is an interpreted language, a program can not be
[type checked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety) before it executes.

Lua values can be of the following types:
```number```, ```string```, ```boolean```, ```table```, ```function```,
```nil```, ```userdata```, and ```lightuserdata```.

If an operation expects differently typed values than it is provided,
the interpreter will attempt to coerce the values to compatible types.
This can cause bugs that are hard to track down. If the interpreter can not
coerce the values, it generates an [error](#exceptions).

Lua coerces values left-to-right.

    local one = "1"
    local two = 2

    print(one + two)
    -- Prints 3
    -- The + is not the concatenation operator in Lua, so the interpreter knows
    -- to coerce the string "1" into a number.

    print(two + one)
    -- Prints 3
    -- "1" is coerced into a number and added to 2

    print(one .. two)
    -- Prints 12
    -- 2 is coerced into a string and concatenated to "1"

    print(two .. one)
    -- Prints 21
