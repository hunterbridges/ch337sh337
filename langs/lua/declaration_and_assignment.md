Variables in Lua are not strongly typed. A variable can hold any type of value
and values are always aware of their own types.

Variables are **declared** using the ```local``` keyword.

    local foo

Variables are **assigned** using the [assignment operator](#assignment_operators)
```=```

    foo = 1

Variables can be **initialized** by declaring and assigning in the same
statement. Variables that are not initialized have the value of ```nil```.

    local foo = 1

Assigning a variable that has not been declared will implicitly declare it in
**global scope**. This is valid Lua, but can lead to unexpected behavior.

    function setbar()
        bar = 2
    end

    setbar()

    print(bar)
    -- Prints 2

**Reading** a variable that has **not been declared** will yield ```nil```.
