In Ruby, variables are [dynamically typed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type-checking_and_runtime_type_information)
and objects are [duck typed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). Since
Ruby is an interpreted language, a program can not be
[type checked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety) before it executes.

In Ruby, [everything is an object](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/). There
are no primitive data types. All values are objects, and all objects are
instances of a [class](#class_declaration). Ruby is heavily object-oriented
and has an extensible type system.

If an operation expects differently typed values than it is provided, Ruby will
simply throw an [exception](#exceptions).
