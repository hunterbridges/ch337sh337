A variableâ€™s scope is determined by the innermost lambda,
[function](#functions), [Ruby block](#callables_by_reference),
module definition, or [class definition](#class_definition) in which
it is declared. Scopes do not inherit local variables from their containing
scopes.

    outer = 1
    def foo()
        puts outer
        # Throws an exception
    end
    foo()
